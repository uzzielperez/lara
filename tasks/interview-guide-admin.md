# Admin Interview Guide: Isabella & Lauren

This guide is designed to help structure the interview and feedback session for the Lara Admin Dashboard.

## Goal
To understand how the admins (Isabella & Lauren) will use the dashboard to manage students and identify gaps in the current UI/UX.

## 1. Introduction & Initial Impressions
*   **Context:** "We've built the first version of the Admin Dashboard where you can see all student applications. We'd like to walk you through it and get your honest feedback."
*   **Question:** "Looking at the dashboard for the first time, what is your immediate impression of the layout and the information shown?"
*   **Question:** "Does the dark theme feel appropriate for an 'Admin Control' area, or would you prefer the lighter theme used by students?"

## 2. Workflow Walkthrough
*   **Task:** Ask them to find a specific student (e.g., "Find a student from the Philippines").
*   **Task:** Ask them to filter the list to only show students who have "Applied" or been "Accepted".
*   **Task:** Ask them to update a student's status from "Saved" to "Applied".
*   **Question:** "How natural does it feel to update a student's progress? Is any step confusing?"
*   **Question:** "What information is MISSING from this table that you need to see at a glance (e.g., specific intake dates, specific notes, etc.)?"

## 3. Application Detail View
*   **Task:** Click into a student's application to see the full details.
*   **Question:** "Is the layout of the student's profile clear? Does it show the right academic and budget information?"
*   **Question:** "Are the 'Quick Action' buttons (Mark Accepted, Mark Rejected) useful? Would you want others?"
*   **Question:** "The 'Download PDF' feature exports the application for your records. Is the information in that export what you need for your external workflow?"

## 4. Feature Gaps & Wishlist
*   **Question:** "If you could add ONE button or ONE piece of data to this screen to make your job faster, what would it be?"
*   **Question:** "How would you prefer to be notified when a new student saves a program? (Email, dashboard badge, etc.)"
*   **Question:** "Do you need a way to message the student directly from this dashboard?"

## 5. Intake & Data Flow (Interactive Demo)
*   **Action:** Have Isabella or Lauren fill out the student intake form themselves.
*   **Action:** Go back to the Admin Dashboard and show them their own entry appearing in real-time.
*   **Question:** "Does seeing the student's budget and target countries here help you decide how to assist them?"

## Notes for the Interviewer:
*   Observe where they hesitate or click the wrong thing.
*   Don't explain how it works—see if they can figure it out.
*   Capture specific phrases they use to describe their pain points.
